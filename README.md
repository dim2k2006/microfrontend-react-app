## Task

You are tasked with creating a way for many teams to work on the same single page web app. To
do this you are to build a microfrontend platform.

## Requirements

The application should have the following features:
- **A menu**: with links to the different microfrontends (MFE) available
- **Main area**: where the MFE renders to
- **Routing logic:** such that the MFE can be switched out without reloading.

Things to take into account:
- Create at least two microfrontends you can demonstrate switching between them.
- Using `single-spa` probably solves too much of the problem for your solution.
- Apply creative and useful approaches to the problem.
- Do not spend time on "busy work", for example, adding a few jest test-cases just because.
- Put thought into every line of code.
- Minimalism is a good thing.
- We encourage you to use the most bleeding edge functionality of the web platform (as long you
  tell us which browser to test in :)
- Feel free to try approaches which would be impractical in practice, but could be interesting from a theoretical perspective.
